## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install a Wallet">
    If you don't have a Solana wallet, download [Phantom](https://phantom.app) or [Solflare](https://solflare.com) and create a new wallet.

    <Warning>
      **Save your seed phrase!** This is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose access.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fund Your Wallet">
    You'll need SOL to place bets and pay for transaction fees. You can:
    - Transfer SOL from an exchange (Coinbase, Kraken, etc.)
    - Buy SOL directly in Phantom with a credit card
    - Receive SOL from a friend
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visit Dubs">
    Go to [dubs.app](https://dubs.app) and click the **Connect Wallet** button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve the Connection">
    Your wallet will ask you to approve the connection. Click **Connect** to continue.

    <Info>
      Dubs will never ask for your seed phrase or private keys.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign In">
    To create your Dubs account, you'll sign a message with your wallet. This proves you own the wallet without sharing any sensitive information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your Profile">
    Choose a username and avatar for your Dubs profile. You can also enter a referral code if a friend invited you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Wallet not connecting?">
    - Make sure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
    - Try refreshing the page
    - Check that you're on the correct network (Solana Mainnet)
    - Disable other wallet extensions that might conflict
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Transaction failing?">
    - Ensure you have enough SOL for the bet plus a small transaction fee (~0.001 SOL)
