## How Sports Betting Works

### Pool-Based Betting (Pari-Mutuel)

Unlike traditional sportsbooks with fixed odds, Dubs uses **pool-based betting**:

- All bets go into a shared prize pool
- Winners split the pool proportionally based on their bet size
- Odds are determined by how players bet, not set by the house

<Info>
**Why pool-based?** This model is provably fair, fully transparent, and works perfectly on the blockchain. There's no "house edge" - just players competing against each other.

## Understanding Payouts

### How Pari-Mutuel Betting Works

With pari-mutuel betting:
- You are **not betting against odds** set by a house
- You are **splitting the prize pool** with other winners
- Your return depends on **how many others picked the same outcome**

### Payout Formula

```
Prize Pool = Total Pot × 0.94 (after 6% fee)

Your Payout = (Your Bet / Winning Team's Total Bets) × Prize Pool
```

<Info>
*Payouts change as more players join the pool before the game starts.*
</Info>

<Warning>
**Payout ≠ Profit**

The formula above returns your **total payout**, not your net profit. To calculate profit:

```
Net Profit = Your Payout - Your Stake
```
</Warning>

### Payout Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Balanced Game">
    **Scenario:** Even split between teams

    | Pool | Amount |
    |------|--------|
    | Home Team Bets | 5 SOL |
    | Away Team Bets | 5 SOL |
    | Total Pot | 10 SOL |
    | Prize Pool (after fees) | 9.4 SOL |

    **If Home wins (you bet 1 SOL on Home):**
    - Your Payout: (1/5) × 9.4 = **1.88 SOL**
    - Your Profit: 1.88 - 1 = **0.88 SOL (88% return)**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Underdog Wins">
    **Scenario:** Heavy favorite loses

    | Pool | Amount |
    |------|--------|
    | Home Team Bets | 8 SOL |
    | Away Team Bets | 2 SOL |
    | Total Pot | 10 SOL |
    | Prize Pool (after fees) | 9.4 SOL |

    **If Away wins (you bet 1 SOL on Away):**
    - Your Payout: (1/2) × 9.4 = **4.7 SOL**
    - Your Profit: 4.7 - 1 = **3.7 SOL (370% return)**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Favorite Wins">
    **Scenario:** Heavy favorite wins

    | Pool | Amount |
    |------|--------|
    | Home Team Bets | 8 SOL |
    | Away Team Bets | 2 SOL |
    | Total Pot | 10 SOL |
    | Prize Pool (after fees) | 9.4 SOL |

    **If Home wins (you bet 1 SOL on Home):**
    - Your Payout: (1/8) × 9.4 = **1.175 SOL**
    - Your Profit: 1.175 - 1 = **0.175 SOL (17.5% return)**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips for Sports Betting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Look for value in underdogs">
    When everyone bets on the favorite, underdog payouts can be massive. A small bet on a plausible upset can yield huge returns.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check the pool balance">
    Before betting, see how the pot is split. This tells you your potential payout. Very one-sided pools may not be worth joining.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invite friends on the other side">
    More opposing bets = bigger pot. Invite friends who might pick the other team to grow your potential payout.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set limits">
    Only bet what you can afford to lose. Start small while you learn how the platform works.
