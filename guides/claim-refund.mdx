Sometimes games don't resolve with a clear winner. In these cases, Dubs automatically refunds all players. Here's everything you need to know about refunds.

## When Do Refunds Happen?

</CardGroup>

## How Refunds Work

When a refund is triggered, the prize pool is split proportionally among ALL players based on their original bet amounts.

```
Your Refund = (Your Bet / Total Pot) × Net Pool
```

### Refund Types

| Type | Fees | When It Happens |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **Normal Refund** | 6% fee applies | Tie game, one-sided pool |
| **Emergency Refund** | No fees | Technical issues, oracle failure |

<Info>
**Normal refunds** still have the 6% fee because the game infrastructure was used. **Emergency refunds** return 100% of funds because no game was properly played.
</Info>

## Claiming Your Refund

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Notified">
    When a game results in a refund, you'll receive a notification. The claim screen will show "Refund" instead of "Prize."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Details">
    The refund screen shows:
    - Why the refund was triggered
    - Your refund amount
    - Original bet amount
    - Fee breakdown (if applicable)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tap Claim Refund">
    Just like claiming a prize, tap the **Claim Refund** button to initiate the return.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign the Transaction">
    Approve the transaction in your wallet. Your SOL will be transferred back to you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Refund Scenarios Explained

### One-Sided Pool

<Accordion title="What happens when only one team has bets?">
If all players bet on the same team (e.g., everyone picked Home), there's no one to pay the winners.

**Example:**
- 5 players bet 1 SOL each on Home
- 0 players bet on Away
- Total pot: 5 SOL

Since there's no "loser" pot to pay the "winners," everyone gets a proportional refund:
- Each player receives: (1/5) × 4.7 SOL = 0.94 SOL (after 6% fee)

This ensures the game is fair and prevents exploitation.
</Accordion>

### Tie Game

<Accordion title="What happens when the score is tied?">
Some sports can end in ties (like soccer). When this happens:

**Example:**
- Home team bets: 3 SOL
- Away team bets: 2 SOL
- Final score: 2-2 (Tie)

Since neither team "won," both pools are combined and refunded:
- Net pool after fees: 5 × 0.94 = 4.7 SOL
- Home players share: (3/5) × 4.7 = 2.82 SOL
- Away players share: (2/5) × 4.7 = 1.88 SOL

Each player gets their proportional share.
</Accordion>

### Emergency Refund

<Accordion title="When does an emergency refund happen?">
Emergency refunds are triggered when:

1. **Oracle Failure** - If the game isn't resolved within 24 hours of the lock time, anyone can trigger an emergency refund
2. **Technical Issues** - Platform administrators can trigger emergency refunds if something goes wrong
3. **Event Cancellation** - If a sports event is cancelled entirely

**Key difference:** Emergency refunds return 100% of funds with no fees, since the game couldn't be played fairly.
</Accordion>

## Finding Refunds

Check for pending refunds the same way you check for prizes:

1. Go to your **Profile** tab
2. Look in the **Claimable** section
3. Refundable games will show "Refund Available"

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Refunds are not automatic transfers!**

Just like prizes, you must actively claim your refund. The SOL remains in the game's escrow account until you claim it.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Sponsored bets:** If someone else paid for your bet (sponsored entry), the refund goes back to the sponsor, not to you.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is my refund less than my bet?">
    Normal refunds have a 6% fee. This covers:
    - Platform operating costs
    - Oracle service fees
    - Blockchain transaction costs

    Only emergency refunds are fee-free.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Game seems stuck - no resolution or refund?">
    If a game hasn't been resolved 24 hours after its lock time, an emergency refund becomes available. You can trigger it yourself:

    1. Open the game details
    2. Look for "Emergency Refund" option
    3. Trigger the refund (anyone can do this)

    This ensures funds are never permanently locked.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Refund claim failing?">
    - Ensure you have ~0.001 SOL for the transaction fee
    - Check your wallet connection
    - Try again after a few minutes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Platform Protections

Dubs has multiple safeguards to ensure you never lose access to your funds:

| Protection | How It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| **On-chain escrow** | Funds are held by the smart contract, not Dubs |
| **24-hour emergency** | Permissionless refund after 24 hours |
| **Authority override** | Dubs can trigger emergency refunds for urgent issues |
| **Transparent rules** | All refund logic is in the public smart contract |
