description: "Collect your payout after your team wins"

When your team wins, it's time to collect your prize! Dubs makes claiming easy with automatic notifications and one-tap payouts.

## When Can I Claim?

You can claim your prize when:

1. The sports game has ended
2. The final score has been recorded
3. Your team has won

<Info>
Games are typically resolved within minutes of the final whistle. Dubs automatically fetches scores from official sports data providers.
</Info>

## Claiming Your Prize

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Notified">
    When a game you're in ends, you'll receive a notification. Winners see a celebration screen with their prize amount!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Your Payout">
    The claim screen shows:

    | Info | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | **Final Score** | The official game result |
    | **Your Prize** | Amount you'll receive in SOL |
    | **Prize Pool** | Total pot after fees |
    | **Fee Breakdown** | Platform and oracle fees |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tap Claim Prize">
    Hit the **Claim Prize** button to initiate the payout. This creates a transaction to transfer your SOL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign the Transaction">
    Approve the claim transaction in your wallet. The SOL will be transferred directly to your wallet.

    <Tip>
      Claiming costs a tiny transaction fee (~0.001 SOL), but your payout far exceeds this!
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Celebrate!">
    Your SOL arrives instantly. You'll see a celebration animation with falling coins to mark your victory!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Payouts Are Calculated

Dubs uses **pari-mutuel betting** where the prize pool is split among winners proportionally:

```
Prize Pool = Total Pot - 6% Fees

Your Payout = (Your Bet / Winning Team's Total Bets) × Prize Pool

Your Profit = Your Payout - Your Bet
```

<Info>
*Payouts change as more players join the pool before the game starts.*
</Info>

### Example Calculation

<Accordion title="See a worked example">
**Game Setup:**
- Total pot: 10 SOL
- Home team bets: 3 SOL
- Away team bets: 7 SOL (including your 2 SOL bet)

**Away Team Wins:**
- Prize pool after 6% fees: 10 × 0.94 = 9.4 SOL
- Your payout: (2 / 7) × 9.4 = **2.69 SOL**
- Your profit: 2.69 - 2 = **0.69 SOL (34.5% return)**

The more lopsided the betting, the bigger the potential return for the underdog!
</Accordion>

## Fee Breakdown

A 6% fee is taken from the prize pool:

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Platform | 4-5% | Operating costs |
| Oracle | 1% | Score verification |
| Referrer | 0-1% | If you used a referral code |

<Info>
Fees are only taken from the winning pool. If you lose, you don't pay any additional fees beyond your original bet.
</Info>

## Finding Claimable Games

Not sure if you have prizes to claim? Check your profile:

1. Go to your **Profile** tab
2. Look for the **Claimable** section
3. Any games with unclaimed prizes will appear here

You can also check **Transaction History** to see past claims and active games.

## What If I Don't Claim?

<Warning>
Your prize doesn't expire, but it's best to claim promptly:
- Your SOL remains in the game's escrow until claimed
- There's no penalty for delayed claims
- However, claiming quickly lets you use your SOL in new games!
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Game ended but can't claim yet?">
    - Final scores take a few minutes to sync after a game ends
    - Overtime games take longer to resolve
    - Delayed games may be marked for manual resolution
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Claim transaction failed?">
    - Make sure you have ~0.001 SOL for the transaction fee
    - Try again - network congestion can cause temporary failures
    - Check your wallet is still connected
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prize amount seems wrong?">
    - Review the fee breakdown on the claim screen
    - Remember the 6% platform fee is deducted
    - Your share depends on how much the winning team bet
