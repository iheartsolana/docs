## Join via Invite

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Invite">
    When a friend shares a game link or sends you an invite, tap on it to open the game details.

    You'll see:
    - The matchup (teams playing)
    - Current pot size
    - Who has already joined
    - Available teams to pick
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Game">
    Check the game details before joining:

    | Info | Description |
    |------|-------------|
    | **Buy-in** | How much SOL to enter |
    | **Lock Time** | When betting closes |
    | **Players** | Who's already in |
    | **Pot Size** | Total SOL in the game |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Your Team">
    Choose the outcome you want to bet on:
    - **Home** - The home team wins
    - **Away** - The away team wins
    - **Draw** - Tie (when applicable)

    <Info>
      You can pick the same team as the creator or bet against them - it's your call!
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Your Wager">
    The buy-in amount is set by the game creator. Make sure you have enough SOL in your wallet.

    <Tip>
      You need a tiny bit extra (~0.001 SOL) to cover the Solana transaction fee.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign the Transaction">
    Tap **Join Game** and approve the transaction in your wallet. Your SOL will be transferred to the game's escrow account on the blockchain.

    You'll see a confirmation screen. You can:
    - Share the game with more friends
