Creating a game on Dubs lets you set up a bet on any upcoming sports event and invite friends to join.

## Create a Sports Bet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse Sports Events">
    From the main screen, tap on the **Sports** tab to see upcoming games across NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB.

    <Tip>
      Games are organized by league and sorted by start time. Look for the matchup you want to bet on.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Game">
    Tap on any upcoming matchup to open the bet creation screen. You'll see:
    - Team names and logos
    - Game start time
    - Any existing bets from friends on this game
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your Team">
    Select which outcome you're betting on:

    | Selection | When You Win |
    |-----------|--------------|
    | **Home** | Home team wins |
    | **Away** | Away team wins |
    | **Draw** | Game ends in a tie (if applicable) |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Your Wager">
    Enter the amount of SOL you want to bet.

    - **Minimum bet**: 0.01 SOL
    - **No maximum**: Bet as much as you're comfortable with

    <Warning>
      Only bet what you can afford to lose. Once placed, bets cannot be cancelled.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite Friends (Optional)">
    Scroll through your friends list and tap to select who you want to invite. Selected friends will receive a notification to join your game.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign the Transaction">
    Tap **Create Game** and approve the transaction in your wallet. This will:
    - Create the game on the Solana blockchain
    - Transfer your wager to the game's escrow account
    - Send invites to selected friends
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Your Game">
    After creation, you'll see a success screen with options to:

## Understanding the Pot

Dubs uses **pool-based betting** (also called pari-mutuel):

```
Total Pot = All bets from all players

Your Payout = (Your Bet / Winning Team's Total Bets) × Prize Pool

Your Profit = Your Payout - Your Bet
```

<Info>
*Payouts change as more players join the pool before the game starts.*
</Info>

<Info>
**Example**:
- Total pot: 10 SOL
- Home team bets: 4 SOL (your 1 SOL + 3 SOL from others)
- Away team bets: 6 SOL
- If Home wins, prize pool = 10 SOL - 6% fees = 9.4 SOL
- Your payout: (1 / 4) × 9.4 = **2.35 SOL**
- Your profit: 2.35 - 1 = **1.35 SOL**
</Info>

## Tips for Game Creators

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Best time to create a game">
    Create games 1-24 hours before they start. This gives friends enough time to join while keeping the action fresh.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Growing the pot">
    The more players, the bigger the pot. Share your invite link widely and invite players who might pick the opposite team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Using referral codes">
    If you have friends new to Dubs, share your referral code. You'll earn 1% of any pots they play in.
