## Why Pool-Based Betting?

Dubs uses **pari-mutuel** (pool-based) betting because it fits how friends actually play together.

**It's a game, not a market.** There are no shares to trade, no liquidity pools to manage, no complex pricing mechanics. Everyone plays the same way: put money in, pick a side, winners split the pot.

| Dubs | Trading Platforms |
|------|-------------------|
| Pick a team, join the pot | Buy/sell shares at fluctuating prices |
| Everyone plays the same role | LPs, traders, arbitrageurs |
| Payouts based on final result | Prices based on market activity |
| Games start when friends join | Markets need liquidity to function |

<Info>
Your potential payout changes as more players join before the game starts. That's not a bug - it's how pool betting works. Late joiners aren't stealing your edge, they're joining the party.

## Why Solana?

Dubs is built on Solana because it offers:

- **Fast transactions** - Games settle in seconds, not minutes
- **Low fees** - Fractions of a cent per transaction
- **Decentralized** - Your funds are secured by the blockchain, not a company

## Fee Structure

Dubs charges a small **6% fee** on winning payouts:

| Recipient | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Platform | 4-5% |
| Oracle | 1% |
| Referrer | 0-1% |

Fees are only taken from the winning pool - if you lose, you don't pay additional fees.
